# Medals - CSV
<p>Contains one python file and one csv file. Code is self enclosed in one python file which contains classes and functions to help handle
interaction with data in the CSV file. The CSV file contains data about the number of medals won by each team at the olympic games. The
project fetches this data and creates a new instance of a "Country" class for each row in the file. Interaction with the data is then handled
through the terminal</p>

 ## medals.csv
<p>medals.csv must be placed in the same folder as the medals.py script to ensure functionality. Any modification to the format of medals.csv 
may result in errors.</p>
